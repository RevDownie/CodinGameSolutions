# CARD GAME RULES
# 2 players
# Dealt variable number of cards at the beginning of the game
# Cards are dealt face down with the next card lying on top of the old card (LIFO - stack)
# FIGHT - Each round the player reveals the top card and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them to the bottom of their deck (all of their own cards first then the won cards)
# WAR - If the cards are equal then both players place the next 3 cards in their deck face down and FIGHT using that sub-deck (wars can form a chain)
# Once a player wins a war all the cards won are added to their deck
# Game is over when one player has no cards remaining and the winner is the other player
# Aces are high
# Each fight counts as a game round


# NOTES
# We don't have to handle an infinite game
# Number of cards per player does not exceed 1000

# INPUT
# N - number of cards for player 1
# The cards of player 1, 1 per line in the format "NumSuit" e.g. 10D
# M - number of cards for player 2
# The cards of player 2, 1 per line in the format "NumSuit" e.g. 10D

# OUTPUT
# 1 or 2 if a clear winner followed by a space and the number of rounds completed
# PAT if drawn game

# STATE
# Round number
# Players decks (and sub decks)

# TO CONSIDER
# The player has a main root deck and sub decks for each war, this forms a chain but we don't need a hierarchy.
# The suits are irrelevant so we should just convert to numeric values
