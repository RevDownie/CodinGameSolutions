Solutions to some of the puzzles on https://www.codingame.com

I mostly use these puzzles to sharpen my skills in languages I don't get to use day to day. Most of the solutions are in Python or Scala rather than my bread and butter C++/C#

Disclaimer: Some of these puzzles I solved in 2014 but have just got around to uploading them
